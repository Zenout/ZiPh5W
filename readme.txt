Full info is contained within the source files.

First use 1...mkb via the simulator, to convert your file to a header file.
(you do not need to use 1 again, just use the code from 2 in your project...)

Then you can use 2...mkb:
 for now, please edit the file "2_ZiPh5W_formattedData.h" with the data that you create above.
 (an alternate solution would be to have '1' create a correctly formatted header, but where's the fun in that :/)
